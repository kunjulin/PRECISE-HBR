## Optional Services (If Applicable)

While the core software is free, organizations may incur costs related to:

### 1. Infrastructure and Deployment (User Responsibility)

- **EHR Integration Costs**: Costs related to integrating with your EHR system (if any) are the responsibility of your organization and your EHR vendor.
- **Cloud Hosting**: If you choose to deploy the application on cloud infrastructure (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS, Azure), standard cloud provider fees apply. These are paid directly to the cloud provider, not to us.
- **Server Resources**: If self-hosting, organizations are responsible for their own server infrastructure costs.

**Estimated Infrastructure Costs** (if cloud-hosted):
- Small organization (<100 clinicians): $10-30/month (paid to cloud provider)
- Medium organization (100-500 clinicians): $30-100/month (paid to cloud provider)
- Large organization (>500 clinicians): $100-300/month (paid to cloud provider)

*Note: These are estimates based on typical cloud provider pricing and vary by provider and usage.*

### 2. Professional Services (Optional, Third-Party)

Organizations may optionally engage third-party consultants for:

- Custom configuration or integration
- Advanced training and onboarding
- Custom feature development
- Compliance certification assistance

**We do not provide these services directly.** Organizations are free to engage any qualified third-party provider or handle these activities internally.
